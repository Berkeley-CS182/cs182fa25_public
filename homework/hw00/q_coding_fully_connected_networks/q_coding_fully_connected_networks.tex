In this coding assignment, you will be building a fully-connected neural network from scratch using NumPy.

Download the .zip file with the starter code and get it to work in either Google Colab or a local Conda environment. 

% You will have the choice between two options:

%% \begin{description}
%%     \item[Use Google Colab (Recommended).] Open \href{\colabgiturl/\questionname/networks.ipynb}{this url} and follow the instructions in the notebook.
%%     \item[Use a local Conda environment.] Clone \url{\publicgiturl}, and refer to \url{\questionname/README.md} for further instructions.
%% \end{description}

Please submit the \texttt{.pdf} export of only the jupyter notebook when it is completed as a part of your submission. In addition, please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
    \qitem \textbf{Did you notice anything about the comparative difficulty of training the three-layer net vs training the five layer net?}
\end{enumerate}

\sol{
Training a five-layer neural network is more difficult and more sensitive to hyperparameters (initialization scale and learning rate).
}
